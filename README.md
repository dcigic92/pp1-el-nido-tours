## User experience

### Project goals
- To create a website which is going to present our tours to our customers and where they can find all the info they might need.
- To eliminate the need for our customers to come to our office until the very beginning of the tour.

### User stories
- As a user, I want to be able to see all the tours and all the attractions that each tour offers.
- As a user, I want to be able to see all the important info about tours before I decide to book my tour.
- As a user, I want to be able to book my tour online.
- As a user, I want to be able to find contact info easily and contact the agency if I have any queries.

## Design

### Colours
Black, white, burlywood and saddlebrown are only colours used in this project.

### Resolved bugs/issues

- Html code for the menu for small screen sizes which I took from other website (mentioned in the credits) was causing bad SEO performance so I modified it. Icon for the menu was inside anchor element which had *href* attribute with *"javascript:void(0);"* as a value, I replaced anchor element with span element and kept only *onclick* attribute.

- Button *more info* was causing bad SEO performance so had to rename it to *about tours* to get better performance even though I prefered first option.

- Confirmation pages were not covering full screen on some devices, header, main content and footer together with margins didn't have enough height so on some screens there was white space under the footer. I had to put fixed height for main content to be sure to cover whole screen for every device even though I would prefer it without fixed height.

### Unresolved bugs/issues

- It is possible to choose dates in the booking form that have already passed. Can't fix that with the HTML and CSS only.

## Deployment

To deploy the website I used GitHub pages and followed these steps:

1. Open your *repository*.
2. Click on *settings* in the *navigation menu*.
3. Under *code and automation* choose *pages*.
4. Select the *main branch* and *save*.
5. Refresh a few times and the link to your website should appear shortly.
